The primary struggle was ensuring that the game logic was robust and handled all edge cases, such as checking for a win condition across rows, columns, and diagonals, as well as detecting ties. Implementing input validation to handle incorrect or out-of-bounds user input was another challenge that required careful attention to detail.
